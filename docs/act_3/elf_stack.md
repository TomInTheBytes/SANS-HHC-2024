??? quote "Fitzy Shortstack"

    Greetings! I'm the genius behind the North Pole Elf Stack SIEM. And oh boy, we’ve got a situation on our hands.

    Our system was attacked—Wombley’s faction unleashed their FrostBit ransomware, and it’s caused a digital disaster.

    The logs are a mess, and Wombley’s laptop—the only backup of the Naughty-Nice List—was smashed to pieces.

    Now, it’s all up to you to help me trace the attack vectors and events. We need to figure out how this went down before it’s too late.

    You’ll be using a containerized ELK stack or Linux CLI tools. Sounds like a fun little puzzle, doesn't it?

    Your job is to analyze these logs... think of it as tracking snow tracks but in a digital blizzard.

    If you can find the attack path, maybe we can salvage what’s left and get Santa’s approval.

    Santa’s furious at the faction fighting, and he’s disappointed. We have to make things right.

    So, let’s show these attackers that the North Pole’s defenses are no joke!

## Hints

??? tip "Elf Stack Intro"

    I'm part of the ElfSOC that protects the interests here at the North Pole. We built the Elf Stack SIEM, but not everybody uses it. Some of our senior analysts choose to use their command line skills, while others choose to deploy their own solution. Any way is possible to hunt through our logs!

??? tip "Elf Stack WinEvent"

    One of our seasoned ElfSOC analysts told me about a great resource to have handy when hunting through event log data. I have it around here somewhere, or maybe it was online. Hmm.

??? tip "Elf Stack Powershell"

    Our Elf Stack SIEM has some minor issues when parsing log data that we still need to figure out. Our ElfSOC SIEM engineers drank many cups of hot chocolate figuring out the right parsing logic. The engineers wanted to ensure that our junior analysts had a solid platform to hunt through log data.

??? tip "Elf Stack Fields"

    If you are using your command line skills to solve the challenge, you might need to review the configuration files from the containerized Elf Stack SIEM.

??? tip "Elf Stack Hard - Email1"

    I was on my way to grab a cup of hot chocolate the other day when I overheard the reindeer talking about playing games. The reindeer mentioned trying to invite Wombley and Alabaster to their games. This may or may not be great news. All I know is, the reindeer better create formal invitations to send to both Wombley and Alabaster.

??? tip "Elf Stack Hard - Email2"

    Some elves have tried to make tweaks to the Elf Stack log parsing logic, but only a seasoned SIEM engineer or analyst may find that task useful.

    Fantastic job! You worked through the logs using the ELK stack like a pro—efficient, quick, and spot-on. Maybe, just maybe, this will turn Santa’s frown upside down!

    Unbelievable! You dissected the attack chain using advanced analysis—impressive work! With determination like yours, we might just fix the mess and get Santa smiling again.

    Bravo! You pieced it all together, uncovering the attack path. Santa’s gonna be grateful for your quick thinking and tech savvyness. The North Pole owes you big time!
