    Hey. Psst, over here. Hey, I'm Chimney Scissorsticks.

    I'm not liking all the tension brewing between the factions, so even though I agreed with how Wombley was handling things, I get the feeling this is going to end poorly for everyone. So I'm trying to get this data to Alabaster's side. Can you help?

    Wombley's planning something BIG in that toy factory. He's not really making toys in there. He's building an armada of drones!

    They're packed with valuable data from the elves working on the project. I think they hide the admin password in the drone flight logs. We need to crack this to prevent this escalating snowball showdown.

    You'll be working with KML files, tracking drone flight paths. Intriguing, right? We need every detail to prepare for what’s ahead!

    Use tools like Google Earth and some Python scripting to decode the hidden passwords and codewords locked in those files.

    Ready to give it a go? It’s going to be a wild ride, and your skills might just turn the tide of this conflict!

    Bravo! You've tackled the drone challenge and navigated through those KML files like a true expert. Your skills are just what we need to prevent the big snowball battle—the North Pole thanks you!

    Well done! You cracked the code from the drones and showed you've mastered the basics of KML files. This kind of expertise will be invaluable as we gear up for what’s ahead!

    But I need you to dig deeper. Make sure you’re checking those file structures carefully, and remember—rumor has it there is some injection flaw that might just give you the upper hand. Keep your eyes sharp!

    Absolutely fantastic! I think you found the most difficult path in, from file carving to SQL injection. Not many can do that, but you've shown you’re ready for anything the factions throw your way!
