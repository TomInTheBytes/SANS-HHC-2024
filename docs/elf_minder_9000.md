??? quote "Poinsettia McMittens"

    Center your mind, and become one with the island!

    Relax...

    This isn't working! I'm trying to play this game but the whole "moving back to the North Pole" thing completely threw me off.

    Say, how about you give it a try. It's really simple. All you need to do is {==help the elf get to the exit==}.

    {==The faster you get there, the better your score!==}

    I've run into some {==weirdness with the springs==} though. If I had created this game it would've been a lot more {==stable==}, but I won't comment on that any further.

## Hints

??? tip "Reusable Paths"

    Some levels will require you to click and rotate paths in order for your elf to collect all the crates.

??? tip "TODO"

    When developing a video game—even a simple one—it's surprisingly easy to {==overlook an edge case in the game logic==}, which can lead to {==unexpected behavior==}.

??? tip "RTD (Read the Docs)"

    Be sure you {==read the "Help" section thoroughly!==} In doing so, you will learn how to use the tools necessary to safely guide your elf and collect all the crates.

## Solution

The terminal tells us to type "answer" in the upper pane of the terminal, and when we do we complete the challenge.

!!! success "Answer"

    Enter "answer" in the terminal as described.

## Response

    The rest of these elves are like corporate zombos. They just run around in circles unless you give them some direction.

    Way to pass them some of your super centered energy. Better you than me, though. I'd let them walk themselves straight off the island.
